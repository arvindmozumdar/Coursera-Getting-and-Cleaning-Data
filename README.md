### Author: Arvind Mozumdar

This is the repository for hosting the R code, Codebook and other details for the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The details of the study and the dataset can be found [here] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Files in the repository

`run_analysis.R` is the primary code for reading and creating a tidy dataset. The code assumes the complete set of file have been downloaded in the working directory as a zip file.

`CodeBook.md` describes the process flow to create the tidy data as well the details of the final dataset created.

The final dataset "tidydata.txt" is uploaded here in the repo and also to the course' submission page.
